# My own portfolio

This might be the 7th portfolio that I am making. Everytime, I push myself to
another level in terms of design and features. But this time, I want to push it
even further beyond.

Like always, I use [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and
[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). However, I wanted to try to add some
blockchain to say "Hey, my portfolio uses blockchain technology" (but in fact, I
just want to integrate [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and
[Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/) just to accept crypto
donations... and brag about myself). I want to add some testing in this website
so I added playwright, a testing library that seems very interesting for my
quest of using only new technologies.
